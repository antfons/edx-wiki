### Links

Markdown supports two style of links: *inline* and *reference*.

In both styles, the link text is delimited by [square brackets].

To create an inline link, use a set of regular parentheses immediately
after the link text's closing square bracket. Inside the parentheses,
put the URL where you want the link to point, along with an *optional*
title for the link, surrounded in quotes. For example:

This is [an example](http://example.com/) inline link.

[This link](http://example.net/) has no title attribute.
